## How to make this bot work?
### its really easy. Firsty you need to download it, then go to `slappey.json` and replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your token you can get on [Discord Developer portal][1] Now make sure you have node installed on your computer if not you can download it [here.][2] after you have node you need to open any terminal and get into the folder. On windows i like to go into that folder in File Explorer and then click on the text bot that show the location and type there `cmd` and hit enter. In cmd you just need to type `npm run dev` and it should say [your bot's name] has logged in.
